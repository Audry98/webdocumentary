                <p>Svend Ejnar Fisker was mainly inspired by data visualization.<br>
                  Data visualization refers to the techniques used to communicate data or information by encoding it
                  as visual objects (points, lines or bars) contained in graphics. The goal is to communicate information
                  clearly and efficiently to users. It is one of the steps in data analysis or data science.

                  Almost all data visualizations are created for human consumption. Knowledge of human perception
                  and cognition is necessary when designing intuitive visualizations. Cognition refers to processes in
                  human beings like perception, attention, learning, memory, thought, concept formation, reading,
                  and problem solving. Proper visualization provides a different approach to show potential connections, relationships, etc. which are not as
                  obvious in non-visualized quantitative data. Visualization can become a means of data exploration.                </p>

                  He primarily works with various forms of digital signal processing. This way he can explore new way
                  of interacting with sound and music, through software.
                  Digital signal processing is the use of digital processing, by computers or more specialized digital
                  signal processors, to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations. The signals processed in

                  this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable in a domain
                  such as time, space, or frequency.
